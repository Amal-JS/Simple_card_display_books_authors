In this project I have used the :

    1. Pagination
    2. ManytoManyField
    3.added media url to show images of authors and books
    4.In home page using django i have provided a simple filter books based on price , realse_date and name
    5.Django ModelForm



So in this project I am just displaying some cards :
book card contains :
    book name
    book image
    book description
    author name

In the home page if you click a card then it will take you to the specafic book page there you can see more info about the book and when you click
in the author page you will redirected to the author page their you can get more info about author.

To, add a new book,author or genre use '/add_info/add_book (author or genre)
